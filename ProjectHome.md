Ideally every mosque (masjid) should be a community centre. This project aims to bring the members of this community together, and to facilitate the running of the mosque.

The project aims to create a model web-site designed for mosques, which can be easily customised for a particular mosque. Its features will include:
  * Prayer timetable
  * Newsletter informing the community of the events and activities
  * Discussion forum to allow participation of the members in the mosque activities
  * Document archive to store and provide information
  * Online donations
